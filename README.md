Preact Setup Timelapse
======================

An attempt to document, from ground up, the setup of a 'modern' SPA. I picked [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) since it appears to be simple enough for my needs but I imagine that most of this would work for React as well. 

See [this page](http://wiki.nikhil.io/Preact_Setup_Timelapse) for quick notes on installing stuff, with links to pertinent changes to project files.

See the [commit history](https://github.com/afreeorange/preact-boilerplate-timemachine/commits/master) for a timelapse of sorts of how the project tooling and setup evolve. The end result

* Uses Preact with JSX
* Uses Sass
* Lints both Sass and ES6
* Base64-encodes fonts and pictures

[This exists](https://github.com/developit/preact-boilerplate) but I wanted to understand the setup instead of using pre-existing boilerplate (which is undoubtedly useful if one's in a hurry.) I look forward to doing this all over again when the tooling changes in 3 months ðŸ¤˜
